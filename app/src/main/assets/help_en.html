<h3>General function</h3>
<p>
    Hopefully usage of Coordinate Joker is rather self explanatory:
</p>
<p>
    <b>1. </b>Enter <b>coordinates</b>,<br>
    <b>2. Possibly</b> enter <b>projection</b> (mind for unit Meter or feet!), otherwise leave
    distance and azimuth 0,<br>
    <b>3. </b>Set <b>value range</b> for x and<br>
    <b>4. </b>send to your desired App with "<b>View</b>" or "Send".<br>
</p>
<h4>Entering formulas</h4>
<p>
    When entering formulas you need to pay attention to the following rules: Coordinate Joker
    replaces the value x within the formulas with the desired values. That operation must result
    in a mathematically correct formula or number. Therefore an expression like
    <b><font color="green">12.3x5</font></b>
    will work for positive x, but an expression like
    <b><font color="red">12.3(4+x)5</font></b>
    unfortunately won't. Strictly speaking, the Geocaching minutes are a decimal number with
    3 decimal places:
    1*10 + 2*1 + 3*0.1 + (4+x)*0.01 + 5*0.001.
    You could therefore write the formula like e.g.:
    <b><font color="green">12.305 + (4+x)*0.01</font></b> for Coordinate Joker being able
    to solve it.
    In addition to the four basic operations Coordinate Joker supports the following mathematical
    operations: <br>
    y^z: exponential function <br>
    y%z: modulo operation <br>
    abs(y): absolute value <br>
    acos(y): arccosine <br>
    asin(y): arcsine <br>
    atan(y): arctangent <br>
    cbrt(y): cubic root <br>
    ceil(y): next higher integer <br>
    cos(y): cosine <br>
    cosh(y): hyperbolic cosine <br>
    exp(y): exponential function (base e) <br>
    floor(y): next lower integer <br>
    log(y): natural logrithm (base e) <br>
    log10(y): decimal logarithm (base 10) <br>
    log2(y): binary logarithm (base 2) <br>
    sin(y): sine <br>
    sinh(y): hyperbolic sine <br>
    sqrt(y): square root <br>
    tan(y): tangent <br>
    tanh(y): hyperbolic tangent <br>
</p>
<h4>Reset</h4>
<p>
    With "Reset" you can clear the formula lines. The projection will be reset to 0 and meter
    units. The value range will be preset to range 0 to 9.
</p>
<h3>Export formats</h3>
<p>
    Within the settings menu you can choose between quick settings and expert settings.
</p>
<h4>Quick Settings</h4>
<p>
    Quick settings offer commonly used presets. If your favorite app is not mentioned there, you may
    select expert settings. You may also contact me to extend presets for your favorite app in a
    later version of Coordinate Joker.
</p>
<h4>Expert Settings</h4>
<p>
    Within the expert settings the export behavior can be configured:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use Export format to switch between GPX, KML, or KMZ.</li>
    <li>You may disable using MIME type if Android does not offer your favorite app for viewing the
        waypoints. Be aware that Android may offer many other apps which are not really useful.
    </li>
    <li>Select 'Share' if you want to share the results via messenger or email instead of viewing
        them on your phone.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Warnings and Errors</h3>
<h4>Formula errors</h4>
<p>
    An error will be shown if the formulas cannot be solved and produce no result.
    It can happen, that some x-values result in valid coordinates, while others don't.
    This case will result in a warning about having obtained less points than requested, but the
    valid points will be shown nevertheless.
</p>
<h4>Export Problems</h4>
<p>
    Depending on chosen settings Coordinate Joker sends the resulting waypoints in GPX, KML or
    KMZ format to other apps for display. Android will offer apps that claim that they can
    handle that format. So it depends on one hand on your installed apps whether and which apps
    are offered to display the waypoints. On the other hand you decide within the Coordinate
    Joker settings which format will be made available. So don't wonder if your favorite
    geocaching app is not offered in the Android app selection menu. It may even happen that no app
    is available at all resulting in an export error message.
</p>
<p>
    A further common problem is that Android may have remembered which app you selected for
    display and does not offer alternatives anymore, so you don't need to repeat the selection
    again and again. If you nevertheless want to change to another app, you need to reset that
    remembered association within Android. Details for doing so may vary depending on your
    Android version and flavor.
