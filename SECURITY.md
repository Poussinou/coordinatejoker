# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes will only be considered for the latest released version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may report vulnerabilities by email to coordinatejoker@gmx-topmail.de or by creating an issue here. Pull requests are welcome, too.
However, I have not been notified reliably about news in my repository in the past, so consider sending an additional notification via email. 

Please keep in mind that I develop the app in my spare time, so processing time may vary from hours to months ;)
Coordinate Joker intentionally does not request any extra rights for using sensitive data or functionality, so chances are good that it is harmless even if a vulnerability is detected.
